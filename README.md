# SE102 Abstract Data Type and Problem Solving

## Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms from the Abstract Data Type (ADT) course at CMU. The projects demonstrate fundamental concepts in data structure implementation and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

### Exercises

   - Covers fundamental Java concepts and syntax
   
2. **Tutorial 2: Vector**
   - `Data.java`: Student data processing using Vector
   - File processing and data manipulation techniques

3. **Tutorial 3: Stack**
   - `MyStack.java`: Custom Stack implementation
   - `MyStudent.java`: Student object representation
   - `MyMain.java`: Stack operations demonstration

4. **Tutorial 4: Queue**
   - `Queue.java`: Queue data structure implementation

   - Features include enqueue, dequeue, and display operations

5. **Tutorial 5: Single Linked List**
   - `LinkedList.java`: Custom Linked List implementation
   - `Node.java`: Node structure for linked list
   - `CovidVaccine.java`: Vaccine record management
   - Demonstrates linked list operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal

6. **Tutorial 6: Tree** *(Available as a PDF assignment)*
   - Covers tree structures, traversal techniques, and applications

7. **Tutorial 7: Graph Adjacency List**
   - `Main.java`: Handles user input and displays adjacency list
   - `AdjacencyList.java`: Graph representation using HashMap
   - Allows users to enter edges interactively and constructs an adjacency list
   - Supports bidirectional edges and includes error handling for invalid inputs

### ADT Assignments
